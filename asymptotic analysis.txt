For BinarySearch:

the total runtime big-theta(N) for addAll = N

the total runtime big-theta(N) for allmatches = theta(N) -> worst case


For LinearSearch:

the total runtime big-theta(N) for addAll= constant

the total runtime big-theta(N) for allmatches = theta(N) 


For ternarysearchtree

the total runtime big-theta(N) for addAll= N

the total runtime big-theta(N) for allmatches = theta(N) -> worst case


For TreeSet:

the total runtime big-theta(N) = log(N) as it is store in a balanced binary tree

the total runtime big-theta(N) for allmatches = theta(N) -> worst case
